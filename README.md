Selected Domain

Financial Services & Fintech – Credit Card Fraud Detection**

Business Context
With the rapid growth of digital payments, online banking, and e-commerce platforms, financial fraud has become a major global challenge.

Credit card fraud leads to:
Significant financial losses  
Customer dissatisfaction  
Reputational damage  
Increased operational costs  
Regulatory compliance risks  

Traditional rule-based fraud detection systems are limited in their ability to adapt to evolving fraud patterns. AI and Machine Learning offer scalable and adaptive solutions to this problem.
